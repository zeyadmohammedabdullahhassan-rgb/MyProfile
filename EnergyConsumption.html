               <p>
                    In the first step of the analysis, I reviewed the available datasets in Power BI to understand the structure and relationships between the tables.
                    The analysis file contains three main tables.
                </p>
                <h4>Table 1 – Building Master</h4>
                <p>
                    This table contains the master data for 11 different buildings.
                    It includes the essential building information used to link consumption and cost data across the model.

                    This table presents the energy consumption units for each building on a yearly basis from 2016 to 2019.
                    It provides detailed insights into usage patterns across different buildings over time.

                <h4>Table 3 – Rates</h4>
                    <p>
                    This table displays the Unit Cost for each year along with the corresponding Energy Type (Water, Gas, Electricity).
                    It is used to calculate the total energy cost by multiplying consumption units by the unit cost.

                <h3><span class="step-number">04</span> Step 2: Transforming the Data using Power Query</h3>
            <p>
    In this step, we transformed the data in Power Query to prepare it for analysis. 
    Specifically, we added a unique Id column in both the <strong>Rates</strong> and <strong>Energy Consumptions</strong> tables 
    by combining the <strong>Year</strong> and <strong>Energy Type</strong> columns. 
    This allows us to create a proper relationship between the two tables in the data model.
</p>
<h4>Creating the Unique Id Column</h4>
<p>
    The unique Id helps link the datasets accurately. 
    For example, combining <em>Year = 2025</em> and <em>Energy Type = Electricity</em> results in <em>2025_Electricity</em>. 
    Similarly, <em>Year = 2025</em> and <em>Energy Type = Gas</em> results in <em>2025_Gas</em>.
</p>
<p>
    This approach ensures that each row is uniquely identified, enabling reliable relationships and analysis across tables.

               <h3><span class="step-number">05</span> Step 3: Data Modeling</h3>
<p>
    In this step, we focused on <strong>data modeling</strong> to establish relationships between the tables in the Power BI data model. 
    By using the <strong>Unique Id</strong> columns created in the previous step, we connected the <strong>Rates</strong> table with the <strong>Energy Consumptions</strong> table.
</p>
<h4>Building Relationships</h4>
<p>
    Establishing proper relationships ensures that the data can be analyzed correctly across tables. 
    For example, linking the <em>Unique Id</em> columns allows us to match the consumption of a specific energy type in a given year with its corresponding rate.
</p>
<p>
    After setting up the relationships, we validated the model to make sure all tables interact correctly, providing accurate results in our reports and visualizations.

                <h3><span class="step-number">06</span> Step 4: Data Visualization and Dashboard Making</h3>
<p>
    In this step, we created dashboards to visualize the data and gain insights. 
    The <strong>Overview</strong> section shows key metrics such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Count of Buildings</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Total Cost</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Units Consumed</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Energy Type Breakdown</strong></li>

</ul>
<p>
    These visuals help quickly understand the overall energy consumption and costs across all buildings.

<h3><span class="step-number">Insights & Recommendations</span></h3>

<h4>Key Insights</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Water Consumption:</strong> Highest usage (88.49% of total energy), but cost remains relatively stable. Peak in 2017, slight increase in 2019. Opportunity for conservation efforts without affecting budget.</li>
    <li><strong>Gas Consumption:</strong> Lowest usage, decreasing trend from 2016–2019, reflected in Gas Cost. Likely due to efficiency improvements and shift to alternative energy sources.</li>
    <li><strong>Need for Deeper Analysis:</strong> More details (building type, activity, policy changes, infrastructure, operations) are needed to fully explain water and gas consumption patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Additional Insights:</strong> Analysis by city, time of day, or day of week can reveal peak usage and areas for conservation, improving resource management.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recommendations</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Conservation Strategies:</strong> Implement water-saving and energy-reduction initiatives based on dashboard insights.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficiency Measures:</strong> Investigate reasons for gas reduction and explore further operational efficiency opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Data Analysis:</strong> Include building type, location, and time periods to better understand energy patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Use dashboards to track changes, detect anomalies, and make data-driven decisions for cost optimization and effective resource management.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Overall, leveraging Power BI and data visualization provides actionable insights that support sustainable energy practices, cost reduction, and operational efficiency.
